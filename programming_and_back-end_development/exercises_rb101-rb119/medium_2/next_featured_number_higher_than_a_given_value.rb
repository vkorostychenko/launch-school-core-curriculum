A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is
a multiple of 7, and whose digits occur exactly once each. So, for example, 49
is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 97 is not (it is not
a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

Write a method that takes a single integer as an argument, and returns the next
featured number that is greater than the argument. Return an error message if
there is no next featured number.

    break if num.odd? && num % 7 == 0 && num.digits.uniq.size == num.digits.size
  end
