# Problem by Natalie Thompson
class Person
  def initialize(name, job)
      @name = name
  end 
end

roger = Person.new("Roger", "Carpenter")
puts roger

# Add 1 line of code for the person class
# and 1 line of code in the initalize method. 
# Other than that don't change Person.

# Output:
# "My name is Roger and I am a Carpenter"
