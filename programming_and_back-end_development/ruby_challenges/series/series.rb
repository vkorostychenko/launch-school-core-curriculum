# Write a program that will take a string of digits and return all the possible
# consecutive number series of a specified length in that string.

# For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

#     012
#     123
#     234

# Likewise, here are the 4-digit series:

#     0123
#     1234

# Finally, if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you should throw an error.
