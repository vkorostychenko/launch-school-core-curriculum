What is used in this class but doesn't add any value?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.information
    return "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a color of green"
  end

end

The answer here is the return in the information method. Ruby automatically
returns the result of the last line of any method, so adding a return to this
line in the method does not add any value and therefore should be avoided.
We also never use the attr_accessor for brightness and color.
However, these methods do add potential value, as they give us the option to
alter brightness and color outside the Light class.
