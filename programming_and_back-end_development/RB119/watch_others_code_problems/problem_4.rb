The maximum sum subarray problem consists of finding the maximum sum of a
contiguous subsequence in an array of integers:

maxSequence [-2, 1, -3, 4, 1, 2, 1, -5, 4) --> should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]

Easy case is when the array is made up of only positive numbers and the maximum
sum is the sum of the whole array. If the array is made up of only negative
numbers, return 0 instead.
Empty array is considered to have zero greatest sum, Note that the empty array
is also a valid subarray.

p max_sequence([]) == 0
p max_sequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]) == 6
p max_sequence([11]) == 11
p max_sequence([-32]) == 0
p max_sequence([-2, 1, -7, 4, -10, 2, 1, 5, 4]) == 12
