In the previous exercise, we developed a procedural method for computing the
value of the nth Fibonacci numbers. This method was really fast, computing the
20899 digit 100,001st Fibonacci sequence almost instantly.

In this exercise, you are going to compute a method that returns the last digit
of the nth Fibonacci number.

def fibonacci_last(n)
  n = n % 60
  first, second = [0, 1]

  (2..n).each do
    first, second = [second, first + second]
  end

  second % 10
end

p fibonacci_last(15)        # -> 0  (the 15th Fibonacci number is 610)
p fibonacci_last(20)        # -> 5 (the 20th Fibonacci number is 6765)
p fibonacci_last(100)       # -> 5 (the 100th Fibonacci number is 354224848179261915075)
p fibonacci_last(100_001)   # -> 1 (this is a 20899 digit number)
p fibonacci_last(1_000_007) # -> 3 (this is a 208989 digit number)
p fibonacci_last(123456789) # -> 4
