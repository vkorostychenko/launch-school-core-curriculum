As we saw in the previous exercises, a matrix can be represented in ruby by
an Array of Arrays. For example:

1  5  8
4  7  2
3  9  6

can be described by the Array of Arrays:

matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6]
]

A 90-degree rotation of a matrix produces a new matrix in which each side of the
matrix is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. For example, the 90-degree rotation
of the matrix shown above is:

3  4  1
9  7  5
6  2  8

A 90 degree rotation of a non-square matrix is similar. For example, the
rotation of:

3  4  1
9  7  5

is:

9  3
7  4
5  1

Write a method that takes an arbitrary matrix and rotates it 90 degrees
clockwise as shown above.

def rotate90(matrix)
  new_matrix = []

  (0...matrix[0].size).each do |column_idx|
    row = []

    (0...matrix.size).each do |row_idx|
      row << matrix[row_idx][column_idx]
    end

    new_matrix << row.reverse
  end

  new_matrix
end

matrix1 = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6]
]

matrix2 = [
  [3, 7, 4, 2],
  [5, 1, 0, 8]
]

new_matrix1 = rotate90(matrix1)
new_matrix2 = rotate90(matrix2)
new_matrix3 = rotate90(rotate90(rotate90(rotate90(matrix2))))

p new_matrix1 == [[3, 4, 1], [9, 7, 5], [6, 2, 8]]
p new_matrix2 == [[5, 3], [1, 7], [0, 4], [8, 2]]
p new_matrix3 == matrix2
