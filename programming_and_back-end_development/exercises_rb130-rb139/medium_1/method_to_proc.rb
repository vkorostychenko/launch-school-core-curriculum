# Fill in the missing part of the following code so we can convert an array of
# integers to base 8 (octal numbers). Use the comments for help in determining
# where to make your modifications, and make sure to review the "Approach/Algorithm"
# section for this exercise; it should prove useful.

# Replace the two `method_name` placeholders with actual method calls
def convert_to_base_8(n)
  n.method_name.method_name
end

# Replace `argument` with the correct argument below
# `method` is `Object#method`, not a placeholder
base8_proc = method(argument).to_proc

# We'll need a Proc object to make this code work
# Replace `a_proc` with the correct object
[8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 33].map(&a_proc)

# The expected return value of map on this number array should be:

# [10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 41]
