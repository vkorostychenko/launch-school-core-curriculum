=begin
There are a number of variables listed below. What are the different types and
how do you know which is which?

excited_dog = "excited dog"   -> local variable
@excited_dog = "excited dog"  -> instance variable
@@excited_dog = "excited dog" -> class variable

We can tell which is which by how the variables are prefixed. Local variables
do not contain anything prefixed, while instance variables are prefixed with
the @ and class variables are prefixed with @@.
