Assume you have the following code:

class House
  attr_reader :price

  def initialize(price)
    @price = price
  end
end

home1 = House.new(100_000)
home2 = House.new(150_000)
puts "Home 1 is cheaper" if home1 < home2
puts "Home 2 is more expensive" if home2 > home1

and this output:

Home 1 is cheaper
Home 2 is more expensive
=end

class House
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :price

  def initialize(price)
    @price = price
  end

  def <=>(other)
    price <=> other.price
  end
end

home1 = House.new(100_000)
home2 = House.new(150_000)
puts "Home 1 is cheaper" if home1 < home2
puts "Home 2 is more expensive" if home2 > home1
