# Fill out the rest of the Ruby code below so it prints output like that shown
# in "Sample Output." You should read the text from a simple text file that you
# provide. (We also supply some example text below, but try the program with your
# text as well.)

# This question requires that you read a simple text file. Try searching the Web
# for information on how to do this, and also take a look at the File class in
# the Ruby documentation. If you can't figure it out on your own, don't worry:
# just put the data directly into your program; an Array with one element per
# line would be ideal.

# Read the text file in the #process method and pass the text to the block
# provided in each call. Everything you need to work on is either part of the
# #process method or part of the blocks. You need no other additions or changes.

# The text you use does not have to produce the same numbers as the sample output
# but should have the indicated format.

class TextAnalyzer
  def process
    File.open('sample_text_1.txt', 'r') { |file| yield(file.read) }
  end
end

analyzer = TextAnalyzer.new
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split("\n\n").count} paragraphs" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split("\n").count} lines" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split(' ').count} words" }

# Sample Output:

# 3 paragraphs
# 15 lines
# 126 words
