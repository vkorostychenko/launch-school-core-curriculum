=begin
You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array
and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to
the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make
this happen, return -1.

For example:
Let's say you are given the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
Your method will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array,
the sum of left side of the index [1, 2, 3] and the sum of the right side of the
index [3, 2, 1] both equal 6.

Another one:
You are given the array [20, 10, -80, 10, 10, 15, 35]
At index 0 the left side is []
The right side is [10, -80, 10, 10, 15, 35]
They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.
