CARS

There is a vehicle company called Cool Car Factory
There are 3 trucks and two cars there:
A blue garbage truck has orange wheels and picks up garbage
An orange recycling truck has blue wheels and picks up recycling
A purple car called Do Not Touch Anything Dirty has black wheels and if it touches something dirty says "hey don't touch any dirty stuff!"
A green race car that races and has black wheels
A red firetruck with black wheels that puts out fires

All truck/car's of these types would have these same attributes and you can pass only one argument on instantiation
All trucks can carry heavy stuff
All cars and the firetruck can go fast
All vehicles can drive
Calling puts on an object of any class should return a sentence describing that object
