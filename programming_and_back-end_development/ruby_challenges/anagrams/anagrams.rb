# Anagrams

# Write a program that takes a word and a list of possible anagrams and selects
# the correct sublist that contains the anagrams of the word.

# For example, given the word "listen" and a list of candidates like "enlists",
# "google", "inlets", and "banana", the program should return a list containing "inlets".
# Please read the test suite for the exact rules of anagrams.
