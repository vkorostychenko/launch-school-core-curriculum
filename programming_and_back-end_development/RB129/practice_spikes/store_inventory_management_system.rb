STORE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You are tasked with implementing a program that simulates a basic inventory
management system for a small store. The store has a limited number of items
in stock, and the system should allow for adding items to the inventory,
updating the stock levels, and retrieving the current stock levels for each
item.

Your program should have the following functionalities:
Add an item to the inventory: Allow the user to input the name, price,
and initial stock level for a new item and add it to the inventory. 
Update stock levels: Allow the user to update the stock level of an existing
item in the inventory by specifying the item name and the new stock level.
Retrieve stock levels: Allow the user to retrieve the current stock level
for a specific item in the inventory by specifying the item name.
