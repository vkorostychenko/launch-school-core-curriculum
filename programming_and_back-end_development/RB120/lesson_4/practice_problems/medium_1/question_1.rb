Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end

Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that you
forgot to put the @ before balance when you refer to the balance instance
variable in the body of the positive_balance? method."

"Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an @!"

Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?

Ben is right because of the fact that he added an attr_reader for the balance
instance variable. This means that Ruby will automatically create a method
called balance that returns the value of the @balance instance variable.
The body of the positive_balance? method will evaluate to calling the balance
method of the class, which will return the value of the @balance instance
variable. If Ben had omitted the attr_reader (or had used an attr_writer rather
than a reader or accessor) then Alyssa would be right.
