Building on the prior vehicles question, we now must also track a basic
motorboat. A motorboat has a single propeller and hull, but otherwise behaves
similar to a catamaran. Therefore, creators of Motorboat instances don't need
to specify number of hulls or propellers. How would you modify the vehicles code
to incorporate a new Motorboat class?
