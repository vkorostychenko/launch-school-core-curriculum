=begin
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time
(which is odd).

Input: an array
Output: an integer

Rules:
  - Given an array of integers
  - find the one that appears an odd number of times
  - there will always be one integer that appears an odd number of times

Algorithm:
  - iterate over unique elements of the input array
    - on each iteration count the current integer in an input array
    - if the count of the current integer is odd
      - return the current integer

def find_it(arr)
  arr.uniq.each do |num|
    return num if arr.count(num).odd?
  end

p find_it([20,1,-1,2,-2,3,3,5,5,1,2,4,20,4,-1,-2,5]) == 5
p find_it([1,1,2,-2,5,2,4,4,-1,-2,5]) == -1
p find_it([20,1,1,2,2,3,3,5,5,4,20,4,5]) == 5
p find_it([10]) == 10
p find_it([1,1,1,1,1,1,10,1,1,1,1]) == 10
