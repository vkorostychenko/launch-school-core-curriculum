# Write a program that can calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands.

# A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or copying of
# a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are vital to cellular
# functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect throughout the cell.
# Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very rare mutation may equip
# the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact, the macro effects of evolution
# are attributable to the accumulated result of beneficial microscopic mutations
# over many generations.

# The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point mutation,
# which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.

# By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands taken
# from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of the minimum
# number of point mutations that could have occurred on the evolutionary path
# between the two strands.

# This is called the Hamming distance.

# The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

# The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length.
# If you have two sequences of unequal length, you should compute the Hamming
# distance over the shorter length.
