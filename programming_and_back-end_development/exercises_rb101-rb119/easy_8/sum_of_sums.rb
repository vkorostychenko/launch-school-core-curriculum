=begin
Write a method that takes an Array of numbers and then returns the sum of the
sums of each leading subsequence for that Array. You may assume that the Array
always contains at least one number.

Examples:

sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == (3) + (3 + 5) + (3 + 5 + 2) # -> (21)
sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == (1) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 5 + 7 + 3) # -> (36)
sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35
=end

def sum_of_sums(arr)
  result = []

  (1..arr.size).each do |n|
    result << arr.take(n)
  end

  result.flatten.sum
end

p sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == 21
p sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == 36
p sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
p sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35
