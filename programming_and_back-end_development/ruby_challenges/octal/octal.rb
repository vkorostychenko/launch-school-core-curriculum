# Implement octal to decimal conversion.
# Given an octal input string, your program should produce a decimal output.
# Treat invalid input as octal 0.
# The only valid digits in an octal number are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

# Note: Implement the conversion yourself.
# Don't use any built-in or library methods that perform the necessary conversions
# for you. In this exercise, the code necessary to perform the conversion is what
# we're looking for.
