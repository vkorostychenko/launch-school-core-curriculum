# In this exercise, your task is to create a new Enumerator object.
# When creating a new Enumerator, you may define what values are iterated upon.
# We'll want to create an Enumerator that can iterate over an infinite list of
# factorials. Once you make this new Enumerator, test it out by printing out the
# first 7 factorial values, starting with zero factorial.

# More specifically, print the first 7 factorials by using an "External Iterator".
# Once you have done so, see what happens if you print 3 more factorials.
# Now, reset your Enumerator (use the rewind method). Finally, print 7 more
# factorials.
